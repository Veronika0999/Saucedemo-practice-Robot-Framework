# Saucedemo

## Project description
The objective of the Saucedemo project was to practice automated testing by creating and executing a few fundamental test cases. This website serves as an ideal platform for honing testing skills due to its simplicity. The test cases focused on basic functionalities such as login, product browsing, and checkout processes. Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in automated testing while working with a straightforward yet effective testing environment.

## Structure of the project
- <code>login-selectors.robot</code> - practising different styles of selectors

- <code>loginWithVerification.robot</code> - this test case automates login functionality on the website. It includes scenarios for both successful and unsuccessful login attempts using if conditions

- <code>numberProducts.robot</code> - this test case automates the process of logging in to the website as a user and verifies the number of available products on the page.
